Simply, I would say that we have two approaches: local and global context. Local context is something similar to word2vec approach which directly is trained for doing predictions of local context. Global context is more like co-occurence matrix analysis which generally uses global information to compare words. \n",
    "Local approach is slower to train and doesn't that much use of global statistics but it better encodes the information of complex local context patterns. In contrast, global approach is faster to train, efficiently uses global statistics about words and their similarity but lacks of local context information and doesn't perform well in complex scenarios since it knows more about words in general but not in concrete cases."
